# Grinnode.live Winter 2020 Bug Bash Challenge and free GRIN/BTC prizes giveaway

[Grin](https://grin.mw/) is a privacy-preserving digital currency built openly by developers distributed all over the world. We are approaching a [Grin v5.0.0 network upgrade (Hard Fork 4: January 2021)](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-v5-0-0-network-upgrade-hard-fork-4-january-2021/7895) and we want to improve on node and wallet stability by performing as large number of tests as possible. For this, we need your help! We are ready to offer prizes and giveways for those who find bugs in Grin!

## How to participate?

We prepared Docker-based test tools to get you started.

### How to setup test environment

1. Fork respository (add link)
2. Create a separate branch dedicated to a particular test run.
3. Choose a test from the issue tracker.
4. Run your local test environment.
5. Charge one of the wallets with some testnet Grins.
6. Perform as many local transactions as you can, play with Wallet APIs.

### How to report the bug

1. Commit output logs and `docker-compose.yml` files to the repository and push to your fork.
2. Prepare URLs that highlight errors in the logs.
3. Open an issue here (link) and add label `Submission` to it.
4. We will review your submission, and if we reproduce it we will change label to `Reproduced`, you may claim a prize for finding a bug!

### How to claim your prize

1. Get in [contact](https://github.com/MCM-Mike/grinnode.live/blob/master/contact.md) with us and provide a URL of the issue.
2. We will respond to you with GRIN transaction file which you can receive with your personal wallet (NOT THE TESTNET WALLET!!!)
3. After transaction is completed we will include the transaction proof at the end of the issue and add a label to `Rewarded` to it.

We will only attempt to reproduce the bug reports. As for remaining tests we will only briefly review the log outputs. We assume users would not attempt to forge successful tests as bugs are paid a lot more.

## Why are we doing this?

We want Grin stack to get more stable. It could use a solid amount of integration tests. We also believe that it is an excellent approach to promote Grin.
